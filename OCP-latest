      - **Log linking is enabled by default.**  Beginning with Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS 4.15, log linking is enabled by default. Log linking gives you access to the container logs for your pods.
      -   **ROSA CLI update.**  The ROSA CLI (`rosa`) was updated to a new version. For information about what has changed in this release, see the  [ROSA CLI release notes](https://github.com/openshift/rosa/releases/tag/v1.2.34). For more information about the ROSA CLI (`rosa`), see  [About the ROSA CLI](https://docs.openshift.com/rosa/cli_reference/rosa_cli/rosa-get-started-cli.html#rosa-about_rosa-getting-started-cli).
      - **Availability zone update.**  You can now optionally select a single availability zone (AZ) for machine pools when you have a multi-AZ cluster. For more information, see  [Creating a machine pool using the ROSA CLI](https://docs.openshift.com/rosa/rosa_cluster_admin/rosa_nodes/rosa-managing-worker-nodes.html#creating_machine_pools_cli_rosa-managing-worker-nodes).
      - **Delete cluster command enhancement.**  With the release of ROSA CLI (`rosa`) version 1.2.31, the  `--best-effort`  argument was added, which allows you to force-delete clusters when using the  `rosa delete cluster`  command. For more information, see  [delete cluster](https://docs.openshift.com/rosa/cli_reference/rosa_cli/rosa-manage-objects-cli.html#rosa-delete-cluster_rosa-managing-objects-cli).

  - ### Q2 2024
    - **ROSA CLI update.** The ROSA CLI (rosa) was updated to a new version. For information about what has changed in this release, see the ROSA CLI release notes. For more information about the ROSA CLI (rosa), see About the ROSA CLI.

    - **Longer cluster names enhancement.** You can now specify a cluster name that is longer than 15 characters. For cluster names that are longer than 15 characters, you have the option to customize the domain prefix for the cluster URL by using the domain-prefix flag in the ROSA CLI (rosa). For more information, see create cluster in Managing objects with the ROSA CLI.

    - **Additional Security Groups for ROSA with HCP.** Starting with ROSA CLI version 1.2.37, you can now use the --additional-security-group-ids <sec_group_id> when creating machine pools on ROSA with HCP clusters. For more information, see Creating a machine pool using the ROSA CLI and the create machinepool section of the ROSA CLI reference.

    -  **Node management improvements.**  Now, you can perform specific tasks to make clusters more efficient. You can cordon, uncordon, and drain a specific node. For more information, see  [Working with nodes](https://docs.openshift.com/rosa/nodes/nodes/nodes-nodes-working.html).
