### Whatâ€™s new with Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS
### Q2 2024

-   **ROSA CLI update.**  The ROSA CLI (`rosa`) was updated to a new version. For information about what has changed in this release, see the  [ROSA CLI release notes](https://github.com/openshift/rosa/releases). For more information about the ROSA CLI (`rosa`), see  [About the ROSA CLI](https://docs.openshift.com/rosa/cli_reference/rosa_cli/rosa-get-started-cli.html#rosa-about_rosa-getting-started-cli).
    
-   **ROSA with HCP regional availability update.**  Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA) with hosted control planes (HCP) is now available in the following regions:
    
    -   Zurich (`eu-central-2`)
    -   Hong Kong (`ap-east-1`)
    -   Osaka (`ap-northeast-3`)
    -   Spain (`eu-south-2`)
    -   UAE (`me-central-1`)
        
        For more information on region availabilities, see  [Regions and availability zones](https://docs.openshift.com/rosa/rosa_architecture/rosa_policy_service_definition/rosa-hcp-service-definition.html#rosa-sdpolicy-regions-az_rosa-hcp-service-definition).
        
    
-   **Added support for external authentication providers.**  You can now create clusters configured with external authentication providers, such as Microsoft Entra ID and KeyCloak. For more information, see  [Creating ROSA with HCP clusters with external authentication](https://docs.openshift.com/rosa/rosa_hcp/rosa-hcp-sts-creating-a-cluster-ext-auth.html#rosa-hcp-sts-creating-a-cluster-ext-auth).
    
-   **Longer cluster names enhancement.**  You can now specify a cluster name that is longer than 15 characters. For cluster names that are longer than 15 characters, you can customize the domain prefix for the cluster URL by using the  `domain-prefix`  flag in the ROSA CLI (`rosa`) or by selecting the  **Create custom domain prefix**  checkbox in the Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console. For more information, see  [create cluster in Managing objects with the ROSA CLI](https://docs.openshift.com/rosa/cli_reference/rosa_cli/rosa-manage-objects-cli.html#rosa-create-cluster-command_rosa-managing-objects-cli).
    
-   **Additional Security Groups for ROSA with HCP.**  Starting with ROSA CLI version 1.2.37, you can now use the  `--additional-security-group-ids <sec_group_id>`  when creating machine pools on ROSA with HCP clusters. For more information, see  [Creating a machine pool using the ROSA CLI](https://docs.openshift.com/rosa/rosa_cluster_admin/rosa_nodes/rosa-managing-worker-nodes.html#creating_machine_pools_cli_rosa-managing-worker-nodes)  and the  [create machinepool](https://docs.openshift.com/rosa/cli_reference/rosa_cli/rosa-manage-objects-cli.html#rosa-create-machinepool_rosa-managing-objects-cli)  section of the ROSA CLI reference.
    
-   **Node management improvements.**  Now, you can perform specific tasks to make clusters more efficient. You can cordon, uncordon, and drain a specific node. For more information, see  [Working with nodes](https://docs.openshift.com/rosa/nodes/nodes/nodes-nodes-working.html).
    
-   **Node drain grace periods.**  You can now configure node drain grace periods in Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA) with hosted control planes (HCP) clusters with the  `rosa`  CLI.
    
    For more information about configuring node drain grace periods, see  [Configuring node drain grace periods in Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA) with hosted control planes (HCP)](https://docs.openshift.com/rosa/rosa_cluster_admin/rosa_nodes/rosa-managing-worker-nodes.html#rosa-node-drain-grace-period_rosa-managing-worker-nodes).
